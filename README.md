These programs are clients for the NXDN networking built into the MMDVM Host.

The Parrot is very simple minded and can only handle one client at a time and
is therefore not suitable for use as a shared resource via the Internet.

The Gateway allows for use of NXDN Talk Groups to control the access to the
various NXDN reflectors. It speaks the same language as Icom repeaters to the
MMDVM so can be used as a gateway for Icom NXDN repeaters. It also
includes experimental support for Kenwood NXDN repeaters.

The Gateway has an ini file that contain the parameters for running the
software. The filename of the ini file is passed as a parameter on the command
line. The Parrot takes the UDP port number to listen on as an argument.

The MMDVM .ini file should have the IP address and port number of the client in
the [NXDN Network] settings.

The file that contains the information about the reachable reflectors is held in
the NXDNHosts.txt file that should be donwloaded from the DVRef.com web site. A
script to do this under Linux is included. This is handled automatically in WPSD
and Pi-Star.

These programs build on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux as well as on Windows using
Visual Studio 2019 on x86 and x64.

This software is licenced under the GPL v2 and is primarily intended for amateur and
educational use.
